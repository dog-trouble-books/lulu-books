# Chapter 2: The dog trainer

![Vicky](img/vicky.png)

One day I was minding my own business when there was a knock at the door Lisa ran to the door and opened it.There standing on the doorstep was a woman that Lisa called Vicky.Vicky had a blue coat on and she wore white high heels.Then Vicky started talking about me and how Lisa should train me better.One time at the dog park a border collie named lucy told me that if a stranger comes through the door and starts talking about you and your behavior he or she is probably a dog trainer so I guess that is who Vicky is.Well anyway Vicky said that she would come back and train me tomorrow.
