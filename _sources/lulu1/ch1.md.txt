![Lisa](img/lisa.png)

Oh this chapter is about Lisa ok well first of all Lisa feeds me way too much because she thinks i’m skinny when I am actually pretty overweight!Next she rarely takes me on walks and so when she does all the coped up energy makes me want to pull on my leash but when I do so Lisa says: Bad dog Lulu bad dog! But I just want more freedom in my life I want to say but of course Lisa does not understand dog language.The last problem is that so little walks means I don’t have much time to do my business so I am forced to do it in the house but when I do so Lisa gets mad and says:Bad dog lulu bad dog!But I want to tell her that I really needed to go but she doesn't understand me.
