Vicky kept her promise and came back the next day.Vicky told Lisa that she was feeding me too much and that a normal German shepherd should weigh about 70 pounds and I weighed 80 pounds.She also told Lisa that I should be walked two times per day and each walk should be about 30 minutes long Lisa was surprised but she obeyed. She also said that by walking me more I would have less energy to pull my owner! Vicky also told her that walking me twice a day would make me have more time to do my business so that would solve the using the house as a toilet problem.The last thing she said was that Lisa should let me play at the dog park with the other dogs without having me on the lish.Vicky helped Lisa train me and I was gradually learning to behave better.
